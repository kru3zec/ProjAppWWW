This is exactly what the switch statement is for. <br/><br/>';

    echo '<br/><br/><br/>While';
    echo '<br/>The meaning of a while statement is simple. It tells PHP to execute the nested statement(s) repeatedly, as long as the while expression evaluates to true.

    echo '<br/><br/><br/>For';
    echo '<br/> For loops are the most complex loops in PHP. They behave like their C counterparts. The first expression (expr1) is evaluated (executed) once unconditionally at the beginning of the loop.
    In the beginning of each iteration, expr2 is evaluated. If it evaluates to true, the loop continues and the nested statement(s) are executed. If it evaluates to false, the execution of the loop ends. <br/><br/>';
